# Hardware-Accelerator-Bit-Q-Apriori-Algorithm
Analysis of Electrocardiogram signals is one of the most useful techniques in diagnosis of heart issues. For proper diagnosis, it is important to extract the most frequent patterns in ECG features of a patient. Bit_Q_Apriori algorithm is a powerful technique to get the frequent items from a database. The motivation to design a hardware accelerator for this algorithm is to improve the existing solutions for ECG analysis. Existing solutions are not operated in real time and they are not scalable as well. With the emerge of Internet of Things (IoT), our designed accelerator will be very useful in a cloud based real time ECG diagnosis application as well as wearable ECG monitoring devices.
